        <h1>Project 1: Personal Portfolio <span class="cubstart-color">(Due Fri, 2/11)</span></h1>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to CS198-75! For your first homework, you'll be building out a single-page complete personal
            portfolio that can serve as your own site for showcasing your education, work experience, achievements,
            and projects using HTML and CSS. You can expect the format of all released homeworks here on out to be
            in this guided doc format. Feel free to collaborate with your teammates on this homework, but remember
            that everyone has to submit their own homework.
        </p>
        <h2 id="project-set-up">Project Set-up</h2>
        <p>For this project (and all projects), you will have a project skeleton to work off of. The skeleton includes
            some JavaScript components, pre-existing styling, and boilerplate code to help you get started. You only
            need to worry about the parts marked with comments corresponding to each part of the homework. </p>
        <p>To fetch the skeleton, you will git clone the skeleton repository into your
            <mark><code>cubstart</code></mark> directory. While at your <mark><code>cubstart</code></mark> directory,
            run the following bash command:
        <pre><code>git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/brandon-m-wang/cubstart-hw1-skeleton.git hw1 && rm -rf ./hw1/.git</code></pre>
        You should now see a new <mark><code>hw1</code></mark> folder in the directory. Accessing it includes all the
        contents of the project.
        </p>
        <p>To open this project in VSCode, run this bash command:
        <pre><code>code hw1</code></pre>
        </p>
        <h2 id="part-1:-the-document-head">Part 1: The Document Head</h2>
        <p>Access the <mark><code>index.html</code></mark> file in the project directory. This is where the layout of
            your site is; think of it as
            the skeleton of the site. </p>
        <p>Recall that the head of the document is where metadata, page information, and important link tags go. You
            are able to link style sheets (your .css files) within the document head, as well as title your page as
            it shows on your browser tab.</p>
        <p>Add a title for your website, and link your stylesheet in the enclosing head tags. The corresponding tags are
            referenced for your convenience.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="" href=""&gt;&#13;&lt;title&gt;Your Name&lt;/title&gt;</code></pre>
        <h2 id="part-2:-html-tags-and-attributes">Part 2: HTML Tags and Attributes</h2>
        <p>Here, you'll be creating your logo, which in this example will be your initials. Within the
            <mark><code>h3</code></mark> tags in the problem, you will add an <mark><code>a</code></mark> tag with your
            initials, with the class of "link" linking to the same page that it is on (referencing the current path is
            possible with "/").
        </p>
        <h2 id="part-3:-css-flex-layout">Part 3: CSS Flex Layout</h2>
        <p>Take a look at the header tag, with classes "header" and "center." This entire section is your page's header,
            which includes your logo, navigation, and other buttons. Think about how a header like this is laid out
            across the top of a page. What kinds of orientation would you need for its elements?</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;header class="header center"&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
            Within the <mark><code>styles.css</code></mark> file, you'll find a class selector for the class
            <mark><code>center</code></mark>. The intent of this class is to vertically center the children of
            elements of this class using a flex-box layout. Accomplish this task by adding the two necessary styles to
            achieve this.
        </p>
        <p>Underneath, there is also a class selector for the class <mark><code>header</code></mark>. Because our header
            in <mark><code>index.html</code></mark> includes both classes "header" and "center," styling the
            "header" class will also cause stylistic changes on our header element. Recall that
            <code><mark>justify-content</mark></code> is the attribute that pertains to manipulating elements in the
            horizontal direction in a flex-box context. Choose the style for <code><mark>justify-content</mark></code>
            that you feel would best fit the look of the header tag and its children.
        </p>
        <div class="inline-img-container">
            <img src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/OBGVr-DdHiQ2y9VOWuhXqXeGnFnyDSBTx7hv"
                class="inline-img" height="150px" width=auto />
        </div>
        <h2 id="part-4:-basic-animation-with-css">Part 4: Basic Animation with CSS</h2>
        <p>You will now create a simple underline animation with CSS. You will notice that the styles in this section
            have a strange selector:</p>
        <pre><code>.link::before {
    content: "";
    display: inline;
    width: 0%;
    height: 0.2em;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    background-color: var(--clr-primary);
    /* transition: */
}</code></pre>
        <p>The <mark><code>::before</code></mark> selector is called a "pseudo-selector," which essentially just refers
            to a pseudo-element that exists before the selected element. You can give this pseudo-element an appearance
            by setting its <mark><code>display</code></mark> to a specific attribute. In this case, we are using it to
            create our text underline. You'll notice now, if you try to hover the links on the header, you will see the
            underline, but it just appears instantly. We want to create this animation, so that it comes out from the
            left.</p>
        <p>The <mark><code>transition</code></mark> property provides a way to control animation speed when changing CSS
            properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a
            property to take place over a period of time. Property changes are found in elements that have properties
            that change on certain actions, for instance hover (mouse over) and focus (selected). The property changes
            can be defined by <mark><code>:hover</code></mark> and <mark><code>:hover</code></mark> selectors as such:
        </p>
        <pre><code>.link:hover::before, .link:focus::before {
    width: 100%;
}</code></pre>
        <p>Observe that the way the underline appears. When the link is either hovered or selected, the width of
            the pseudo-element <mark><code>.link::before</code></mark> changes to 100%, else it is 0 when it isn't
            hovered/selected. We want to animate this change. Fill in the transition style so that we achieve a smooth
            animation.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-css">transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function];</code></pre>
        <p>In the property section, you will want to target <code><mark>width</mark></code> as mentioned previously. As
            for the timing-function, you can use <mark><code>ease-in</code></mark>, but there are many options
            available. Try playing around with the timing of the animation and see the results by hovering your links
            and logo!
